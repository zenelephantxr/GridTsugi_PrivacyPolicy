## Summary (TL;DR)
- The Game is designed to work **offline** and **does not require an internet connection**.  
- We store **gameplay data locally on your device only** (e.g., scores, levels completed, time taken, and a spatial-anchor room ID to keep your room setup).  
- We **do not** use third-party analytics/ads and do **not** sell or share data.  
- If we later add an **optional online leaderboard**, we will clearly notify you in-game, request consent (where required), and update this policy **before** any online transfer.

---

## Information We Process

### A. Gameplay & Progress Data (local)
- **Scores and performance metrics** (e.g., score value, time taken to complete a level)  
- **Progress tracking** (e.g., played levels, won levels, total number of levels completed)  
- **Completion stats** (e.g., best times, streaks, attempts)

We use this data solely to run core game features (continue your progress, show stats/achievements, on-device difficulty tuning).

### B. Spatial & Room Setup Data (local)
- **Spatial anchor room ID** (or similar anchor/scene identifier) used to remember where you scanned/placed the grid in your room so you don’t have to redo setup each time.

We do **not** store passthrough video frames or raw room scans ourselves. Any room-mapping, tracking, or sensor processing is handled by the Meta Quest system. We only keep a local identifier that lets the Game relocate your previously placed content.

### C. Optional Contact Data You Provide
- If you **manually contact us** (e.g., via email or form) you might provide **your name, email address, or phone number**.  
- This is **outside the Game** and is used only to respond to your inquiry/support request. It is **not required** to play.

---

## What We Do Not Collect or Use
- No facial tracking, camera frames, or raw depth/mesh data saved by us.  
- No advertising SDKs or third-party analytics.  
- No sale or “sharing” of personal data (as defined by many privacy laws).

---

## Where Your Data Lives & Transfers
- **On-device only (by default):** All Game data listed above is saved in the Game’s private storage on your Meta Quest device and is **not transmitted to us**.  
- **Platform backups:** If you enable **Meta/Quest cloud backup** at the OS level, your device may back up the Game’s local data to Meta’s cloud. That backup is a platform feature controlled by Meta and your device settings — we do not control or receive that backup.

---

## Legal Bases (EU/EEA & similar jurisdictions)
- **Performance of a contract:** We process on-device game data to deliver the Game you chose to play.  
- **Legitimate interests:** Keeping a spatial anchor ID so you don’t have to re-scan your room enhances usability and player experience.

We do not use the data for profiling, advertising, or automated decision-making with legal effects.

---

## Data Retention
- **Gameplay & spatial anchor data:** Kept **only on your device** for as long as you keep the Game installed, or until you clear/reset data from the Game’s settings (if available) or via your device’s app data management.  
- Uninstalling the Game typically removes local data stored in the app sandbox (subject to OS behavior and any backups you enabled at the platform level).

---

## Security
- Data is stored in the Game’s **private app storage**. We rely on the device’s operating system sandboxing and platform security.  
- We do not add extra encryption beyond what the OS provides. Because all data remains on-device (unless you enable OS backups), risk of third-party access is reduced.

---

## Your Choices & Controls
- **Play offline:** No network connection is required for core gameplay.  
- **Reset/clear data:** If the Game provides a “Reset Progress” or “Clear Anchors/Room Setup” option, you can use it to remove local data. You can also uninstall the Game.  
- **Manage backups:** Control platform cloud backup in your Meta Quest device settings.  
- If you believe your platform backup contains Game data you want deleted, adjust device settings and follow Meta’s instructions for deleting app backups.

---

## Children’s Privacy
The Game should be used only with a **Meta account** and in accordance with Meta’s age policies and parental controls. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data via the Game, please contact us so we can assist.

---

## Third Parties
- **No third-party SDKs** for analytics, ads, or social sharing are integrated at this time.  
- Platform providers (Meta) may independently process telemetry or device information per their terms. We do not receive that data.

---

## Future Feature: Optional Online Leaderboards (Not Yet Active)
If we add an **optional** online leaderboard:
- We will clearly notify you in-game before activation and update this Privacy Policy.  
- We may process and transmit limited data such as **score/time, level identifiers, and a display name or platform account ID** necessary to show rankings.  
- We will specify where the data is stored (our servers or a trusted leaderboard provider), how long it’s retained, and how you can opt out or delete your leaderboard entry.  
- We will not use leaderboard data for advertising.

No online transfers will occur until this section is activated and the policy is updated.

---

## International Use
Because the current Game is offline, we do not transfer your data internationally. If a future leaderboard is introduced, we will identify any international transfers and apply appropriate safeguards.

---

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes to the Game or legal requirements. Material changes will be highlighted in-game or on our website, with a new **Effective date**.
