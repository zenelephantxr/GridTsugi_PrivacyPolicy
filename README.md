## Summary (TL;DR)
- The Game is designed to work **offline** and **does not require an internet connection**.  
- We store **gameplay data locally on your device only** (e.g., scores, levels completed, time taken, and a spatial-anchor room ID to keep your room setup).  
- We **do not** use third-party analytics/ads and do **not** sell or share data.  
- GridTsugi: Maze of Woven Bridges now includes an online leaderboard feature that allows players to compare their level completion times with other players globally and among friends.

---

## Information We Process

### A. Gameplay & Progress Data (local)
- **Scores and performance metrics** (e.g., score value, time taken to complete a level)  
- **Progress tracking** (e.g., played levels, won levels, total number of levels completed)  
- **Completion stats** (e.g., best times, streaks, attempts)

### Meta Platform User Data (for online leaderboards)
When online leaderboards are active, we collect and process data from the Meta Platform SDK including User ID, User Profile information (display name, profile picture), User Age Group, and Friends list data. See the "Online Leaderboard Feature" section for complete details.
We use this data solely to run core game features (continue your progress, show stats/achievements, on-device difficulty tuning).

### B. Spatial & Room Setup Data (local)
- **Spatial anchor room ID** (or similar anchor/scene identifier) used to remember where you scanned/placed the grid in your room so you don’t have to redo setup each time.

We do **not** store passthrough video frames or raw room scans ourselves. Any room-mapping, tracking, or sensor processing is handled by the Meta Quest system. We only keep a local identifier that lets the Game relocate your previously placed content.

### C. Optional Contact Data You Provide
- If you **manually contact us** (e.g., via email or form) you might provide **your name, email address, or phone number**.  
- This is **outside the Game** and is used only to respond to your inquiry/support request. It is **not required** to play.

---

## What We Do Not Collect or Use
- No facial tracking, camera frames, or raw depth/mesh data saved by us.  
- No advertising SDKs or third-party analytics.  
- No sale or “sharing” of personal data (as defined by many privacy laws).

---

## Where Your Data Lives & Transfers
- **On-device only (by default):** All Game data listed above is saved in the Game’s private storage on your Meta Quest device and is **not transmitted to us**.  
- **Platform backups:** If you enable **Meta/Quest cloud backup** at the OS level, your device may back up the Game’s local data to Meta’s cloud. That backup is a platform feature controlled by Meta and your device settings — we do not control or receive that backup.
- **Meta Platform data (leaderboards):** User ID, profile information, age group, friends list, and leaderboard scores are transmitted to and stored on Meta's Platform servers located globally. This data is subject to Meta's Privacy Policy and international data transfer safeguards.
  
---

## Legal Bases (EU/EEA & similar jurisdictions)
- **Performance of a contract:** We process on-device game data to deliver the Game you chose to play.  
- **Legitimate interests:** Keeping a spatial anchor ID so you don’t have to re-scan your room enhances usability and player experience.

We do not use the data for profiling, advertising, or automated decision-making with legal effects.

---

## Data Retention
- **Gameplay & spatial anchor data:** Kept **only on your device** for as long as you keep the Game installed, or until you clear/reset data from the Game’s settings (if available) or via your device’s app data management.  
- Uninstalling the Game typically removes local data stored in the app sandbox (subject to OS behavior and any backups you enabled at the platform level).
- **Meta Platform leaderboard data:** See "Online Leaderboard Feature" section for specific retention policies.

---

## Security
- Data is stored in the Game’s **private app storage**. We rely on the device’s operating system sandboxing and platform security.  
- We do not add extra encryption beyond what the OS provides. Because all data remains on-device (unless you enable OS backups), risk of third-party access is reduced.

---

## Your Choices & Controls
- **Play offline:** No network connection is required for core gameplay.  
- **Reset/clear data:** If the Game provides a “Reset Progress” or “Clear Anchors/Room Setup” option, you can use it to remove local data. You can also uninstall the Game.  
- **Manage backups:** Control platform cloud backup in your Meta Quest device settings.  
- If you believe your platform backup contains Game data you want deleted, adjust device settings and follow Meta’s instructions for deleting app backups.
- Delete leaderboard data: Request deletion of your leaderboard entries and associated Meta Platform data by contacting us at [your email].

---

## Children’s Privacy
The Game should be used only with a **Meta account** and in accordance with Meta’s age policies and parental controls. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data via the Game, please contact us so we can assist.

---

## Third Parties
- **No third-party SDKs** for analytics, ads, or social sharing are integrated at this time.  
- Platform providers (Meta) may independently process telemetry or device information per their terms.

---

## Online Leaderboard Feature
GridTsugi: Maze of Woven Bridges now includes an online leaderboard feature that allows players to compare their level completion times with other players globally and among friends.

What Data We Collect for Leaderboards
When you play the Game with an active Meta account, we collect and process the following data through the Meta Platform SDK to provide leaderboard functionality:
- User ID (Oculus ID): A unique identifier assigned by Meta to your account. We use this to associate your scores with your account and identify your position on leaderboards.  
- User Profile Information: Your Meta display name/username and profile picture/avatar image. We display this information on leaderboards so you and other players can see recognizable player identities instead of anonymous IDs.  
- User Age Group: Basic age group information provided by Meta. We collect this to comply with Meta Platform requirements and may use it for age-appropriate content filtering if needed in future updates.  
- Friends List: Information about your Meta friends who also play the Game. We use this to provide friend-specific leaderboard views and highlight your friends' positions on global leaderboards.
- Gameplay Performance Data: Your level completion times, scores, and level identifiers. This data is submitted to and stored on Meta's leaderboard servers to calculate and display rankings.

### How We Use This Data
We use the data collected above solely for the following purposes:
- Submit and retrieve leaderboard entries - Recording your completion times and displaying rankings
- Personalize leaderboard displays - Highlighting "Your Position" or "Your Rank" on leaderboards
- Display player identities - Showing usernames and profile pictures next to leaderboard entries for recognition
- Enable friend-based features - Filtering leaderboards to show only your friends' scores and highlighting friends on global leaderboards
- Maintain competitive integrity - Associating scores with specific user accounts to prevent duplicate or fraudulent entries

We do not use this data for advertising, profiling, selling to third parties, or any purpose unrelated to providing the leaderboard functionality. 
### Where Leaderboard Data Is Stored
- Leaderboard data (User ID, scores, times, display names, profile pictures) is transmitted to and stored on Meta's Platform servers via the Meta Platform SDK.
- We do not operate our own separate leaderboard servers. All leaderboard data processing occurs through Meta's infrastructure.
- This data may be transferred internationally as part of Meta's global infrastructure, subject to Meta's data protection safeguards.

### Data Retention for Leaderboards
- Active leaderboard entries: Retained as long as they remain within the top rankings for each level or until you request deletion.
- User profile data: Cached temporarily for display purposes and refreshed periodically from Meta's servers.
- Historical data: May be retained by Meta's Platform services according to their retention policies.

### Your Rights And Choices
You have the following rights regarding your leaderboard data:
- Opt out: You can choose not to participate in leaderboards by not completing levels or by playing offline.
- Request deletion: You can request deletion of your leaderboard entries by contacting us at [your contact email]. We will work with Meta to remove your data from leaderboards within 30 days.
- View your data: You can see your leaderboard entries within the Game's leaderboard interface.
- Control profile visibility: Your display name and profile picture visibility are controlled through your Meta account settings.

### Legal Basis (EU/EEA users)
- Consent: By playing levels and having your scores submitted to leaderboards, you consent to the collection and processing of your leaderboard data as described.
- Legitimate interests: Providing competitive social features enhances gameplay experience and player engagement.
